<p>Off and on for the past few years, I have kept a gratitude journal, but the
habit has been wishy-washy.  I believe it is a good habit.  A reasonably
positive mindset pays dividends individually, and (hopefully) tends to spread
to others.</p>

<p>November 2020 I had a paper on my wall to add something I was grateful for each
day, so I could easily write them down, but also to be reminded of them each
morning.  I copied the few notes and reminders of what I&#8217;m grateful for from
that gratitude journal here and aim to continue.</p>

<p>I hope sharing them publicly will encourage me to maintain this practice and
others to do the same.  (My goal was to transcribe the earliest entries as
accurately as possible, that&#8217;s why they look so&#8230;  &#8220;ratchet&#8221;? unkempt? Just me
scribbling on the wall ü§∑ )</p>

<li><p>2020-12-11 sat on the porch sipping coffee for 10 mins in the soft cool rain.
&#8220;if this isn&#8217;t good, IDK what is&#8221; -Vonnegut or something; these moments are
somehow over-rated and under-rated at the same time.  sipping tea or coffee
or nothing and just watching the sun rise&#8230;  or just listening to the rain.
great way to spend 10 minutes.</p></li>
