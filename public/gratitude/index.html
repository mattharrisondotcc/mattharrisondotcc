        <h1>gratitude</h1><time>published 2021-01-04</time></header><p>Off and on for years I have kept a gratitude journal, but it&rsquo;s scattered and
unmaintained (the &ldquo;journals&rdquo; as well as the habit itself). I believe it is a
good habit, though.</p>
<p>gahhh idk how not to sound stupid.
A reasonably positive mindset pays dividends individually,
and (hopefully) tends to spread to others.</p>
<p>November 2020 I had a paper on my wall to add something I was grateful for each
day, so I could easily write them down, but also to be reminded of them each
morning.  I copied the few notes and reminders of what I&rsquo;m grateful for from
that gratitude journal here and aim to continue.</p>
<p>I hope sharing them publicly will encourage me to maintain this practice and
others to do the same.  (My goal was to transcribe the earliest entries as
accurately as possible, that&rsquo;s why they look so&hellip;  &ldquo;ratchet&rdquo;? unkempt? Just me
scribbling on the wall ü§∑ )</p>

<li>
<p>2021-01-16  I realized I haven&rsquo;t had to commute for years. The impact this
has on physical and mental health (at least, mine) cannot be understated.
I&rsquo;ve taken this for granted, but it has been so good for me and I am grateful
for it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2021-01-10  I am so glad I don&rsquo;t smoke, and that I can run and walk and ride
my bike and go to the gym. I&rsquo;m glad for good weather and bad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2021-01-05  I am happy that the gym is open again after the holiday season.
I&rsquo;m not ashamed to admit I am happy with the progress I&rsquo;m making on this
project.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>2020-12-11 sat on the porch sipping coffee for 10 mins in the soft cool rain.
&ldquo;if this isn&rsquo;t good, IDK what is&rdquo; -Vonnegut or something; these moments are
somehow over-rated and under-rated at the same time.  sipping tea or coffee
or nothing and just watching the sun rise&hellip;  or just listening to the rain.
great way to spend 10 minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2020-12-05 Glad I finished my walk before it rained.  Thx, bladder!</p>
