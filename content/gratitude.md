Off and on for years I have kept a gratitude journal, but it's scattered and
unmaintained (the "journals" as well as the habit itself). I believe it is a
good habit, though.

gahhh idk how not to sound stupid.
A reasonably positive mindset pays dividends individually,
and (hopefully) tends to spread to others.

November 2020 I had a paper on my wall to add something I was grateful for each
day, so I could easily write them down, but also to be reminded of them each
morning.  I copied the few notes and reminders of what I'm grateful for from
that gratitude journal here and aim to continue.

I hope sharing them publicly will encourage me to maintain this practice and
others to do the same.  (My goal was to transcribe the earliest entries as
accurately as possible, that's why they look so...  "ratchet"? unkempt? Just me
scribbling on the wall ü§∑ )

## 2021-01

* 2021-01-16  I realized I haven't had to commute for years. The impact this
  has on physical and mental health (at least, mine) cannot be understated.
  I've taken this for granted, but it has been so good for me and I am grateful
  for it.

* 2021-01-10  I am so glad I don't smoke, and that I can run and walk and ride
  my bike and go to the gym. I'm glad for good weather and bad.

* 2021-01-05  I am happy that the gym is open again after the holiday season.
  I'm not ashamed to admit I am happy with the progress I'm making on this
  project.

* 2021-01-04 if I've never said it before...  VIM (sorry not sorry emacs-ians
  /s)

## 2020-12

* 2020-12-11 sat on the porch sipping coffee for 10 mins in the soft cool rain.
  "if this isn't good, IDK what is" -Vonnegut or something; these moments are
  somehow over-rated and under-rated at the same time.  sipping tea or coffee
  or nothing and just watching the sun rise...  or just listening to the rain.
  great way to spend 10 minutes.

* 2020-12-05 Glad I finished my walk before it rained.  Thx, bladder!
